# wael-exames — local exam grading

Grades scanned NESA exam PDFs on the DGX Spark using a two-stage local-LLM pipeline:
`pdftoppm` render → `qwen3-vl` (handwriting transcription, port 8003) →
`qwen3.6-35b` (grading, port 8888) → JSON + Markdown report.

The three sample papers in this folder are `English paper.pdf`, `Math paper.pdf`, and
`SET paper.pdf`.

## Testing it against the 3 PDFs

### 0. Prerequisites (one-time)

- **Local tools:** `uv` (Python 3.12 manager), plus `pdftoppm` (poppler) and `magick`
  (ImageMagick). On macOS: `brew install uv poppler imagemagick`.
- **Install deps:** from the repo root, `uv sync` (creates the 3.12 venv and installs
  pydantic/httpx/pytest from `uv.lock`).
- **DGX models must be up.** Both endpoints in `examgrader/config.py` must answer `200`:

      curl -s -o /dev/null -w "vlm:%{http_code}\n"    http://192.168.10.246:8003/v1/models
      curl -s -o /dev/null -w "grader:%{http_code}\n" http://192.168.10.246:8888/v1/models

  If either is not `200`, the vision/grader container is stopped — restart on the DGX
  (`ssh dgx-spark`, then `~/launch-qwen3-vl.sh` for the vision model; see the design spec
  for the grader). Each paper takes ~2 minutes to grade.

### 1. Grade all three at once

    ./grade_all.sh

This runs each paper and writes results under `out/`. (It just loops the single-paper
command below.)

### 2. Or grade one paper at a time

    uv run python grade.py "Math paper.pdf"    --subject Math
    uv run python grade.py "English paper.pdf" --subject English
    uv run python grade.py "SET paper.pdf"     --subject SET

`--subject` is optional (defaults to the file name); `--out DIR` changes the output folder
(default `out`).

### 3. Read the results

For each paper, three files appear in `out/`:

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `<paper>.report.md` | Human-readable: per-question marks, justification, ⚠ flags, total |
| `<paper>.results.json` | Same data as structured JSON (for downstream tooling) |
| `<paper>.transcript.json` | What the vision model *read* off each page (check OCR accuracy here) |

Quick look:

    cat "out/Math paper.report.md"

To sanity-check the handwriting reading, open the `*.transcript.json` and compare a few
answers against the scan — that isolates "did it read the page right" from "did it grade
right."

### 4. Run the unit tests (no DGX needed)

    uv run pytest

All LLM calls are mocked, so this runs offline and fast. Use it to confirm the code is
healthy before a live run.

## How it works

1. `examgrader/pdf_to_images.py` — `pdftoppm` renders pages; near-blank scans are dropped.
2. `examgrader/transcriber.py` — sends each page to the vision model, which returns
   structured `{question, max_marks, student_answer, read_confidence}` records. A single
   unreadable page or question is skipped, never the whole paper.
3. `examgrader/grader.py` — the `MarkScheme` interface grades each question. The POC uses
   `LLMJudge` (the reasoning model decides correctness). Production swaps in a
   marking-guide implementation without touching the reading stage.
4. `examgrader/report.py` — writes the per-question JSON + a readable Markdown report.

## Verified results (2026-06-22)

- Math paper: 68/100. Objective-section transcription matched ground truth exactly
  (Q1 a–e, Q2, Q3a).
- English paper: 94.5/100.
- SET paper: not yet run — it is the third sample and a good first test of this guide.

## Performance

Transcription and grading both run their model calls concurrently (thread pool;
`vlm_concurrency` and `grader_concurrency` in `config.py`). Grader calls parallelize ~3.4×;
the vision model is GPU-bound on the single GB10 and scales ~2×, so transcription is the
dominant cost (~6 s/page). A full paper runs in roughly 75 s–2 min depending on page count.
Lowering `render_dpi` (200→150) is the cheapest further speedup if OCR accuracy holds.

## Flags in the report

- `blank_answer` — the student left it blank (a legitimate 0; informational only).
- `low_read_confidence` — handwriting was present but hard to read; **gets a ⚠** — check the
  scan against the transcript.
- `grading_failed` — the grader call errored for that question (scored 0); **gets a ⚠**.

The ⚠ marker fires only on review-worthy flags, not on blank answers.

## Known limitations (POC)

- **`max_total` is fixed at 100** rather than derived from the transcribed questions.
- The vision model scales only ~2× concurrently (memory-bound at its current util); more
  speed needs lower DPI or more VRAM headroom for batching.
- LLM-judge grading is best-effort; production should use the official marking guide via a
  `MarkScheme` implementation.

## Notes

- Endpoints, model names, and render DPI live in `examgrader/config.py`.
- Student PDFs and rendered pages are gitignored (they contain minors' names).
- DGX serving details (the `qwen3-vl` container, memory tuning) are in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-exam-grading-framework-design.md`.
